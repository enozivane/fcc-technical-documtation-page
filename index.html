          You’ve found the Discord Developer Documentation! These pages are
          dedicated to showing you all the ways that you can use Discord to make
          cool stuff. Whether you’re looking to create awesome bots for your
          community, empower your applications with our API, or hook us right
          into your game with Rich Presence or the GameSDK, Discord has
          something for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of our documentation is on GitHub and and we &lt;3 corrections and
          improvements!

          report incorrect documentation, open an issue on our issue tracker.

        <p>
          Bots and apps are the lifeblood of the Discord development community.
          They come in all shapes and sizes, from small hobby projects for your
          server with friends, to huge projects that live in hundreds of
          thousands of servers. We love seeing the unique, fun, and sometimes
          downright strange (in a good way) creations that come from our
          community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discord offers an open API to serve requests for both bots and OAuth2
          integrations. So whether you’re making your own /wumpus commands or
          looking to Log In With Discord, we’ve got you covered.
        </p>
        <p>So go do it! Go! Go make an app and create something awesome.</p>

        <p>
          We love games, and we love helping game developers. If YOU have a game
          that you want to supercharge with Discord, then we have just the thing
          for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Game On Discord <br />
          If you haven’t yet noticed, Discord allows you to sell your game right
          from Discord servers! We’ve got a whole suite of tools to help bring
          your game to life on Discord. Need networking? Have networking! Want a
          friends list? Take relationships too!
        </p>
        <p>
          Rich Presence <br />
          No matter where your game lives, it should have a first-class
          experience in Discord. Rich Presence is the way to make that a
          reality! We got tired of exchanging usernames, friend codes, and lobby
          passwords, so we created Rich Presence, an easy-to-use,
          easy-to-integrate way to get people playing games together that lets
          you:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Display rich game data on your players’ profiles
            </li>
            <li>
              Empower them to send game invites to each other
            </li>
            <li>
              Ask to Join and Spectate their friends' games
            </li>
            <li>
              Spend more time playing together and less time setting up
            </li>
            <li>
              It’s free, easy, and self-serve, so check out the GameSDK Activity Manager and get started!
            </li>
          </ul>

        <header>API Reference</header>
        <p>
          Discord's API is based around two core layers, a HTTPS/REST API for
          general operations, and persistent secure WebSocket based connection
          for sending and subscribing to real-time events. The most common use
          case of the Discord API will be providing a service, or access to a
          platform through the OAuth2 API.
        </p>
        <p>Error Messages</p>
        <p>
          In API v8, we've improved error formatting in form error responses.
          The response will tell you which json key contains the error, the
          error code, and a human readable error message. We will be frequently
          adding new error messages, so a complete list of errors is not
          feasible and would be almost instantly out of date. Here are some
          examples instead:
